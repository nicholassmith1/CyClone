OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This project seeks to aggregate various idempotent code clone discovery techniques in order to compensate for the various strengths and weaknesses of different stategies. \
    Currently, CyClone ships with a simple Lucene-based multi-line exact text matcher and a modified version of the SourcererCC strategy for clone discovery. \
    These initial strategies were chosen for their speed, in order to create a responsive search baseline.\n\n\
    The tool can be used by openning the clone search Window (from the Window menu), highlighting the desired peice of code, right clicking and initiating a 'find clones' search.
